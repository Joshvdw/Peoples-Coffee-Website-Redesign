            <h4>Our Story</h4>
            <p>In 2004, Matt founded Wellington’s first fair trade roastery, Peoples Coffee.
                Describing himself as a second-generation coffee entrepreneur,
                he began roasting coffee at a time when Wellington was already ensconced as New Zealand’s coffee capital.
                “I remember drinking my first coffee in the late 1990s at Olive Cafe on Cuba Street and it was life changing.
                Coffee became the central part of creating ideas and talking about things.’’</p>
          </div>

          <div class="story-image col6 colS12">
            <img class="col12" src="images/story.jpg" alt="story-image">
          </div>

          <div class="story-text2 col6 colS12">
            <p>However, Matt realised that the city really needed fair trade coffee.
                Peoples' coffee is grown by small fair trade farmers in Africa, and Central and South America.
                It is roasted in Newtown and served in two of its own cafés, along with other cafés around town
                including Lamason Brew Bar on Lombard Lane, owned by Matt’s brother, Dave.
                “Wellington is a melting pot of liberal, bohemian culture.
                We sit down and make decisions, start businesses, get married, all over a cup of coffee."</p>
          </div>

          <div class="story-text3 col6 colS12">
            <p>“There is enormous pride among Wellingtonians about our coffee culture.
                The way our psyche is wired is that we think our coffee is the best in Wellington & everything else is second rate.’’</p>

            <p>Coffee is grown on trees, by people, utilising the limited resources of the planet.
                A simple but beautiful interaction that enables us to come together over a cup of coffee.
                An interaction that now needs an immediate response from ourselves.
                A response that provides assurances that the quality we experience in the cup is wedded not only to taste
                but environmental responsibility and fair prices paid to farmers.</p><br>
            <p>Our response to the challenges faced by the environment and small-lot farmers is to source only organic
                and fair trade coffee through long-term cooperative partnerships.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="organic-text col6 colS12">
            <h4>Organic</h4>
            <p>Organic coffee is a choice for the environment more than it is a health choice for drinkers.
                Small lot farmers who utilise organic farming techniques ensure the sustainability of their environment for generations to come.
                But these techniques come at a cost and are very labor intensive which is why an Organic Premium is built into the prices we pay.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="fair-trade-text col6 colS12">
            <h4>Fair Trade</h4>
            <p>Farmer cooperatives are the heart and soul of the Fair Trade system as they provide the small lot farmer with access to the coffee market.
                Long-term partnerships coupled with social premiums built into the price we pay for coffee is the only lasting way to make a difference at origin,
                providing opportunities for farmer initiated community development projects.</p>
